            Unique & Personalized Hair Cuts{" "}
          </h3>
          <p className={classes.tabContentp}>
            Hair cutting is an art form & foundation for styling the hair. It
            gives shape and structure to hairstyles. Without a good,
            professional cut, styling has no basis. When designing a cut, you
            need four important aspects: precision, good technique, creativity
            and a sense of balance. It incorporates balance, line, and movement
            and face shape.
          </p>
          <p className={classes.tabContentp}>
            At Beauty Bee Salon, all hairstylists have been trained to cut hair
            in a structured and formal learning process. We give unique and
            personalized haircuts that flatter your face. Our stylists always
            focus on highlighting your unique angles to bring out the best in
            your features.

          <p className={classes.tabContentp}>
            Hair is the richest ornament of women, was said by Martin Luther
            King. An energizing revitalizing ritual can stimulate the scalp and
            nourish the hair from root to tip to increase hair density. The hair
            is exposed to daily aggression like ultra-violet rays, dust,
            pollution, excessive heat, styling etc. & a ritual is the secret to
            endless happiness after all that. We at Geetanjali, use products
            with a special ingredient which proves to be the natural source of
            life for hair. We provide an ultimate experience & solution for all
            hair types. Witness the transformation of your hair with a huge
            range of hair rituals available at Geetanjali. We use scalp and hair
